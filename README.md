###Dependencies/Install

Please install the following first:

* [PCAP-core v2.0+](http://github.com/ICGC-TCGA-PanCancer/PCAP-core/releases)
* [cgpVcf v2.0+](http://github.com/cancerit/cgpVcf/releases)

Please see these for any child dependencies.

Once complete please run:

./setup.sh /some/install/location

Please use `setup.sh` to install any other dependencies.  Setting the environment variable `CGP_PERLLIBS` allows you to to append to `PERL5LIB` during install.  Without this all dependancies are installed into the target area.

Please be aware that this expects basic C compilation libraries and tools to be available.
